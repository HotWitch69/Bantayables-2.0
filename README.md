# Bantayables-2.0

'What is Bantayables 2.0?'
**Semi-supervised framework** designed as an extension to the original unsupervised Bantayables model, aimed to work in conjunction with the latter to provide Business Banking a more holistic set of potential business-operators from the retail customer base.

'Bantay 1.0 vs. Bantay 2.0;'
*Bantayables 2.0 builds on the success of Bantay 1.0, directly utilizing feedback/engagement data from Business Banking's campaigns to serve as the target base for the former's self-learning algorithm*
